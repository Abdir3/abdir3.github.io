						<h1><span>My</span> Sunshine</h1>
				
					<div>
						<span>You’re the sunshine that makes all my days feel so right <br>
							Your radiance makes me always want to hold you tight <br>
							Always making me better in every which way <br>
							Extreme honesty, too, positively does play <br>
							You’re very empathetic, putting others first <br>
							Even at the expense when it makes you feel worse <br>
							I know that you have hurt, and I know my own part <br>
							But there’s nothing that’s stronger than all of my heart <br>
							And it comes back to you, and value in your love <br>
							To extinguish your fear, I’d put nothing above <br>
							Trust takes time to develop, but that is just fine <br>
							There is nothing to rush when the feeling’s divine <br>
							When somebody is willing to change for the best <br>
							It’s the first step in showing they’re up to the test <br>
							I’ll support you in any way possible, too <br>
							Right behind you to help you with all you pursue <br>
							There’s no reason to stress on your own future goals <br>
							You deserve to achieve them with your lovely soul <br>
							I accept where I’ve been wrong with causing you pain <br>
							And would spend a lifetime to replace it with gain <br>
							At the end of each tunnel there’s always a light <br>
							Hoping to give my all to show you just how bright
